###AUTH CONTEXT###

<h1>Problem  Discription</h1>
Create a context by the name AuthContext
create a AuthContextProvider component which will wrap the entire application around it
create a isAuth and a toggleAuth function
pass these values into your context provider
create a navbar with a button to login or logout (change with the isAuth variable)
use the reqres.in api for login to achieve this task
create another component which will display the login status of the user along with the token
these two components should not share props and the app state should be accessed through the context api
